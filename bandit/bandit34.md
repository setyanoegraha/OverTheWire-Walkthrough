# Bandit33 -> 34: The Final (waiting for the continuation)

[Challenge](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit34.html)

---

I logged into `bandit33` using the usual SSH command:

```bash
ssh bandit33@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

This time, there was no challenge to solve - just a single file in the home directory and I opened it:

```bash
cat README.txt
```

Inside was a message congratulating me for finishing the final level of the Bandit wargame.It mentioned that there are no more levels for now, but new ones might be added in the future. Until then, I was encouraged to try out other wargames on OverTheWire.

That's it - **Bandit Complete!**
**A great learning experience from start to finish**.

```bash
At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are constantly working
on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.
Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!
```
